# MDC-Web Checkbox Example - React

This folder contains an example of using mdc-checkbox within React.

It is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` within this folder
2. Run `npm start` to start the demo server
3. If your browser has not been opened automatically, then navigate to the location written on the console to view the demo

## Notes

The checkbox wrapper is implemented within `src/Checkbox.js`, which is annotated with comments. There are also simple wrapper components for both the checkbox wrapper classes and the checkbox label (both implemented as pure functions).
